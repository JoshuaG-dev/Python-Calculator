This a beginner-level Python project: a simple calculator that takes two user-input numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on user choice.

## Features
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers
- Input validation for division by zero
- Simple and beginner-friendly code structure

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have PYthon installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the '.py' file.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory.
4. Run the script using the following command:

'''bash
python calculator.py

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter two numbers and choose an operation.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3

## Purpose
This was my first mini-project while learning Python. It helped me practice:
- Taking user input
- Using conditionals (if/elif/else)
- Performing basic arithmetic operations
- Handling errors like division by zero

## Status
- This project is complete as a basic exercise. I may improve or expand it in the future as I learn more.
